/// crosses the boundary because the preceding byte is alphanumeric. The
/// three ASCII bytes also cannot sit inside a multi-byte UTF-8 character.
///
/// `added_tokens` are the byte sequences matched atomically *before*
/// pretokenization (see `Tokenizer::encode_with_added_tokens`), each paired
/// with its `rstrip` flag; a candidate boundary is rejected when an
/// occurrence of one straddles it, since the halves would otherwise be
/// BPE-encoded as plain text. Only tokens that contain a space can ever
/// straddle a boundary (every boundary sits on a space byte), so for typical
/// vocabularies the check costs nothing. If no occurrence crosses a
/// boundary, greedy leftmost-longest matching restarted there reproduces the
/// single-pass matches: the matcher's only state is its scan position, and
/// no match can carry it across the boundary.
